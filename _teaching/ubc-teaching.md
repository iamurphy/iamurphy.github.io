During my Master's degree, I was able to work as a teaching assistant in several different courses. I performed all the typical TA duties like marking, holding office hours, and teaching weekly tutorials amongst other things. I was even lucky enough to be able to teach an entire lecture section of a course during the Fall 2020 semester! 

Here's a list of the courses I was able to be a TA for:

- STAT 404 - Design and Analysis of Experiments
- STAT 200 - Elementary Statistics for Applications
- STAT 203 - Introductory Statistics
- STAT 302 - Introduction to Probability (Taught entire lecture section for the Fall 2020 semester)
