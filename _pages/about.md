Hi! My name is Ian and I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia. I am interested mainly in studying longitudinal and clustered data, as well as looking at new machine learning technologies to help solve the many issues that come along with this type of data!

Other things you should know about me (non-statistics related):
* I love cooking, baking, and especially experimenting in the kitchen.
* My favourite singers/musicians are Taylor Swift, Sia, Lorde, and Florence + the Machine. 
* I can and will binge watch an entire season of reality TV in one sitting as a way to relax. Am I proud of it? Absolutely.
