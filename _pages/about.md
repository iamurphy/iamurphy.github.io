Hi! My name is Ian and I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia. I am interested mainly in studying longitudinal and clustered data, and have recently been interested in functional data analysis.

Other things you should know about me (non-statistics related):
* I love cooking, baking, and especially experimenting in the kitchen.
* My favourite singers/musicians are Taylor Swift, Sia, Lorde, and Florence + the Machine. 
* I can and will binge watch an entire season of reality TV in one sitting.
